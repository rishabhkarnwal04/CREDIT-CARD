This project implements an AI-powered Credit Card Fraud Detection System to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes transaction patterns and detects anomalies based on historical data.

Features
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks
Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, handling imbalanced data, outlier detection
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
Visualization: Fraud vs. Non-Fraud distribution, transaction amount patterns
Deployment: Flask API for real-time fraud detection
Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Flask (for API integration)
